## Overview

**Legacy2Reqs** is a Streamlit-powered tool that helps engineering teams in the automotive industry extract high-level system and function-specific requirements directly from legacy Python codebases. This workflow accelerates requirement traceability, refactoring, and modernizationâ€”enabling safer, more agile, and standards-compliant product development.

## Why Extract Requirements from Legacy Code in Automotive?

Automotive suppliers (OEMs, Tier 1/2) often deliver the same base software to multiple customers, customizing features for each project. As legacy code accumulates, capturing and formalizing requirements brings multiple critical benefits:

### 1. **Ensures Compliance and Functional Safety**

- Requirements-centric development is essential for meeting ISO 26262 and other automotive standards for safety, traceability, and verification.

### 2. **Promotes Reuse & Modularization**

- Translating legacy code into explicit requirements enables code/function reuse across projects, facilitating modular architectures and reducing redundant engineering effort.

### 3. **Simplifies Legacy Modernization and Refactoring**

- By making underlying requirements explicit, teams can confidently migrate or refactor code (e.g., to new architectures or languages) while ensuring compatibility with original system intents.

### 4. **Drives Knowledge Transfer & Reduces Dependency on Experts**

- Many legacy codebases are understood by a handful of engineers. Requirement extraction documents the system, reducing key-person risk and aiding onboarding.

### 5. **Improves Customer Alignment and Accelerates Customization**

- Clear requirements make it easier to deliver project-specific variants, satisfy audits, and communicate system capabilities and boundaries to Tier 1/2 customers and OEMs.

## Features

- **Paste Any Python File:** Instantly extract and view both high-level system requirements and per-function requirements.
- **Expandable, Numbered Requirement Cards:** Each requirement is interactive and linked to its code snippet.
- **Export to CSV:** Download a categorized list of all requirements (System/Functional) with serial numbers.
- **Designed for Automotive Legacy Modernization & Safety Workflows**
